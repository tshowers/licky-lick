<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, or submitting information, to this site. This site is intended for use by residents of the United States.
</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>

<p>By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information following this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Active Information Collection</h2>

<p>Like many web sites, this site actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate with us directly via e-mail, feedback form, and chat room. Some of the information you submit may be personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on).
Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what information is optional.</p>

<h2>Passive Information Collection</h2>

<p>As you navigate through this web site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.
This site uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user’s computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site.
</p>

<p>A “cookie” is a bit of information that a web site sends to your web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences.
</p>

<p>We do use cookies at this site.</p>

<p>“Internet tags” (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the web site server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer.
</p>

<p>We do use Internet tags at this site.</p>

<p>“Navigational data” (“log files,” “server logs,” and “clickstream” data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.
</p>

<p>This site uses navigational data.</p>

<h2>Use and Disclosure of Information</h2>

<p>Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of our site, to customize the website to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, we will not combine such information with other actively collected information. We will take reasonable measures to prevent personally identifiable information from being combined with passively collected information unless you consent otherwise.
</p>

<p>We will not disclose your personal information to any company.</p>

<h2>Access and Correction</h2>

<p>To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified below. We will take reasonable steps to update or correct personally identifiable information in our possession that you have previously submitted via this site.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Reasonable steps are performed to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit information from your computer to our site. We implement best practices to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should, therefore, take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other exclusive access features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>If this Privacy Policy changes, the revised policy will be posted on this site. Please check back periodically, and especially before you provide any personally identifiable information.
