## Summary

The goal is to make a business run smoothly and efficiently. Consider how information is processed and used throughout an organization. The software should enhance a company, not weigh it down and make it react sluggishly or not at all.

Business challenges are usually: lack of vision, infrastructure, and a transparent management system. Using the software presented here helps create a view, build the necessary infrastructure, and operate a management system that keeps a pulse of business activity.

## Vision

* Eliminate App Fatigue
* Familiar look and feel to process
* Pro-active data analysis and suggestion
* Find instead of search

## Challenges of current software

* Can’t get a clear picture of your business if the email is separate from the e-commerce while your sales opportunities are separate from your calendar
* Most systems you put information in, and when you need the data, you retrieve it, not with this project, once you put data in, the AI goes to work analyzing information and sends you alerts on what you should be doing

# Business Goals

Automate as many processes as possible. An active organization does not waste time on non-essential tasks but instead places that energy on building the brand.

Through research and development, the following functionalities help build a successful business:

- Lead Generation and Conversion
- Build a strong sales team with lead generation, online forms, opportunity and relationship tracking.
- Client Fulfillment
- The request/fulfillment system gives you a better handle on how quickly client requests are fulfilled. By operating in an open environment the entire staff can address overlooked items with the visual alert system.
- Empower Management
Use charts to review real-time snapshots of each employee's activities and progress.
- Implement Strategy and Monitor Progress
Using activity-centric features brings true accountability throughout the company.
- Analyze Prospect and Client Demographics
Customize reports on the fly for realtime information from any department.
- Keep the Company Mission Top-of-Mind
Display your company's mission statement on each user's home page.

The use of a data-focused application with an integrated process will help a business become more predictable and lead to improving not only staff productivity but client services as well.

This project is an attempt to offer a complete enterprise solution that can be set up in a few minutes at a fraction of the price of similar systems.
