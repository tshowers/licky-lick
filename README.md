## Summary

Currently, communication with software is one-way. You click, tap, enter information, and the software waits for your next action. I believe we are long overdue for a conversational approach with all software. Just like two people talking, with a give and take, we should all be interacting with the software.  Once we click, tap, or enter information, the software should analyze this action and respond with something meaningful or just an acknowledgment that the software understands our response.

Besides, with data spread out among various software platforms and applications, how can anyone honestly know what's going on in a company? Email in one app, products, and services in another, documents spread out, it's a wonder how any organization performs.

As advanced as computers are today, it is very disappointing that they are used merely for either information storage or information retrieval. I would have thought by now that software would have advanced to be more conversational. Where if I add data, post a link, or request a website, that is just the beginning of the dialog with the computer. Imagine if we talked to each other, the way we interact with computers. I tell you something; you store it your memory, but do not return a response other than OK,  submitted, or tell me a list of a thousand things based on a keyword?

I believe computers should be providing continuous feedback like a real-world conversation. And most importantly, using the power it posses to provide meaningful responses and information. Adding a contact, or selling a product through my website should be the beginning of a dialog. The action of clicking submit is an indicator that I want to talk about the information I either requested or entered.

Intelligent services are a set of software agents responding to the context of your submit click — a continuous dialog between you and the computer.

The product roadmap is to develop a News, CRM, Communication, Project Management, e-Commerce, and Knowledge Management integrated suite of applications.  Implement intelligent services into each, then focus on the need for Finding instead of Searching.

## Vision

* Eliminate App Fatigue
* Make interacting with software more conversational
* Familiar look and feel throughout a workflow
* Pro-active data analysis and suggestion
* Innovative User experience
* Find instead of search

## Challenges of current software

* Can’t get a clear picture of your business if the email is separate from the e-commerce while your sales opportunities are separate from your calendar
* Most systems you put information in, and when you need the data, you retrieve it, not with this project, once you put data in, the AI goes to work analyzing information and sends you alerts on what you should be doing

# Business Goals

Automate as many processes as possible. An active organization does not waste time on non-essential tasks but instead places that energy on building the brand.

Through research and development, the following functionalities help build a successful business:

- Lead Generation and Conversion
- Build a strong sales team with lead generation, online forms, opportunity and relationship tracking.
- Client Fulfillment
- The request/fulfillment system gives you a better handle on how quickly client requests are fulfilled. By operating in an open environment the entire staff can address overlooked items with the visual alert system.
- Empower Management
Use charts to review real-time snapshots of each employee's activities and progress.
- Implement Strategy and Monitor Progress
Using activity-centric features brings true accountability throughout the company.
- Analyze Prospect and Client Demographics
Customize reports on the fly for realtime information from any department.
- Keep the Company Mission Top-of-Mind
Display your company's mission statement on each user's home page.

The use of a data-focused application with an integrated process will help a business become more predictable and lead to improving not only staff productivity but client services as well.

This project is an attempt to offer a complete enterprise solution that can be set up in a few minutes at a fraction of the price of similar systems. If you are affected by any of the following, this software can save you time and dollars. A must-have application if you suffer from any of the following:

- Disconnected Communication
- No Data Alignment
- Personnel in Multiple Locations
- Poor Document Sharing
- No Project Communication Among Clients and Suppliers
- Poor Customer Service
- No Calendar Sharing
- Software deployment issues
- Lost Leads
- Multiple Applications
- No Real-time Data Analysis
- Disconnected Shopping Cart, Inventory Management, Contact Management and Lead Tracking

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run 'ng run library-build' to build all libraries prior to running any of the standalone applications.

* npm start
* npm run library-build
* npm run tester
* npm run home
* npm run news
* npm run crm
* npm run km
* npm run commerce

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
